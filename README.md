Converting swift message to json formate

Before running this project, First build this project.
Then on your machine create 2 different folders on any location, as i did like this: file:C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Folder One      "file:C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/Folder Two?fileName=MT103.json"
If you created the folders on different location then: add those locations in the parameter of from() and to() methods, which are located in RouterNew.java files.
